![Project Screenshot](https://github.com/AMAN-ARABZADEH/Maze-generation-DFS-JS/blob/main/maze.png)

## Introduction

This project uses p5.js to generate a random maze based on the recursive backtracker algorithm. The maze is displayed on a canvas and uses a vibrant coloring scheme for visualization.

## Features

- Dynamic maze generation with adjustable grid sizes.
- Highlighting of the currently processed cell.
- Vibrant coloring to distinguish between processed and unprocessed paths.

## Sources and Inspiration

- [p5.js Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/line)
- [Maze generation algorithm on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)
- Inspired by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser that supports ES6. 

## Future Work

- [ ] Add a start and end point to the maze.
- [ ] Implement a maze solver.
- [ ] Enhance the visualization with more animations and sound effects.
